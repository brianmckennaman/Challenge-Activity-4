# Challenge-Activity-4

The goal of this activity was to design a simple multiple choice app that tracks the user's answers and saves both their score and initials in local storage and to retrieve that data.

First, I designed the initial page with html, then styled all the elements using css.

However, I greatly struggled with the JavaScript and API functionality, and was unable to get the full functionality of the page working. 

Here is a link to the deployed page: 
A screenshot of the page can be found below:
